## Reading Journal Debrief

We'll be reviewing your [compiled
answers](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/paulruvolo/SoftDesSp16Prep/blob/master/processed_notebooks/day6_ reading_journal_ responses.ipynb).


## Recursion Practice

### Pascal's Triangle

Write a function called choose that takes two integer, n and k, and returns
the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n (this is also known as
the number of [combinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination) of k
items from a pool of n). Your solution should be implemented recursively using
[Pascal's rule.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_rule)


### Levenshtein Distance

Write a function called `levenshtein_ distance` that takes as input two strings
and returns the [Levenshtein
distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) between the two
strings. Intuitively, the Levenshtein distance is the minimum number of edit
operations to transform one string into the other (for this reason Levenshtein
distance is sometimes called "edit distance"). These edits can either be
insertions, deletions, or substitutions. Note that Levenshtein distance is
similar to [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_ distance),
but works for strings of differing lengths

Here are some examples of these operations:

1. **k** itten → **s** itten (substitution of "s" for "k")
2. sitt**e** n → sitt**i** n (substitution of "i" for "e")
3. sittin → sittin**g**  (insertion of "g" at the end).

While this function seems initially daunting, it admits a very compact
recursive solution. You can either work on your own to see the recursive
solution, or use the recursive solution given in the Wikipedia article.

We will be memoizing this function in the next reading journal to make it more
computationally efficient.


#### Making change

Write a program that takes as input a number of cents, n, along with the
denominations of some coins, d, and outputs the number of unique ways that
change can be made for n cents using the coins d.

For example:


```
make_change(10,[1, 5, 10]) -> 4
```

Specifically,

10 pennies

2 nickels

1 nickel 5 pennies

1 dime


## Turtle World

Today we will explore drawing by means of attaching pens to the tails of
turtles and forcing them to move around in intricate patterns. Since we're
actually quite fond of Turtles, luckily we don't have to hurt any actual
turtles but we can do this in simulation! Allen has written a wonderful
package called
[TurtleWorld](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/swampy/turtle.html)
that implements this sort of drawing environment in Python (the original
concept goes way back to 1967 and the [Logo programming
language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_ %28programming_language%29)).
President Obama [wrote his first line of
code](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/09/obama-code_ n_6294036.html) with
a similar environment.

As part of your day 5 reading journal, you wrote several functions that
operate on Turtles:

* `square` takes as input the side length of a square and draws the square to the Turtle world canvas
* `polygon` takes as input the side length and the number of sides of a regular polygon
* `circle` takes as input the radius of a circle, which it draws by approximating a circle as a regular polygon with a large number of sides
* `arc `extends `circle `with an extra angle parameter that controls what fraction of the circle to draw in degrees

Each of these functions is a **generalization** of the previous function. You
also went on to draw flowers, pies, letters, spirals, or something else
altogether! Thinking about how to break up large problems like these into
logical smaller pieces is one of the most fun challenges in software design.

It's often useful to think about what low-level **primitive**  functions (such
as drawing regular polygons) would be most useful in completing a task.
Identifying these common primitives can help **refactor**  messy code with many
copy-paste sections into a set of reusable functions with clean interfaces.
From [Think
Python](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython005.html#toc45):

> The **interface**  of a function is a summary of how it is used: what are the
parameters? What does the function do? And what is the return value? An
interface is “clean” if it is “as simple as possible, but not simpler.
(Einstein)”


Regardless of how complex a function is to implement, its interface should be
easy to understand. Well-designed functions do exactly what they say they will
do without surprises.


### Teleportation, Cloning, and Other Unethical Experiments on Turtles

In addition to the functions you wrote in the day 5 reading journal, there are
a few other Turtle Tricks that may prove useful.

A Turtle is a Python object, which we will learn more about next week. Turtles
have attributes, which we can access directly to change their behavior. You've
already seen one of these, the delay attribute, which can be used to speed up
slowpoke Turtles.

``` python
speedy = Turtle()
speedy.delay = 0.01
```

Other important Turtle attributes include `x` and `y` position, and `heading`.
You can set these attributes directly to teleport the Turtle around the
canvas.

Since Turtles are simple creatures, mainly defined by their current position
and heading, we can "clone" them by copying these attributes to a new Turtle.


``` python
leo = Turtle()
# Create a new Turtle with the same attributes as the first
don = Turtle()
don.x = leo.x
don.y = leo.y
don.heading = leo.heading
# don.bandana_color = "purple" # TODO: Ninja functionality not yet implemented
```

As an exercise, encapsulate this functionality in a `clone `function that
takes a Turtle argument and returns a **new** Turtle with the same position
and heading, leaving the original Turtle untouched.


## Fractals

[Fractals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) are geometrical constructions
that display self-similar repeated patterns at every scale as you zoom in.
They are often extremely beautiful, and are [found throughout
nature](http://www.wired.com/2010/09/fractal-patterns-in-nature/). Fractals
are also useful across many fields, from antenna engineering to poetry to
finance. Check out [Yale's Panorama of Fractals and their
Uses](http://classes.yale.edu/fractals/Panorama/welcome.html) for more
examples.

Today, we will teach our turtles to draw fractal shapes using recursion. A
very cool recursive drawing we can create is called the snowflake curve (or
[Koch snowflake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake)). To get
started, let's write a function called`snow_ flake_side` with the following
signature:

``` python
def snow_ flake_side(turtle, length, level):`
    """ Draw a side of the snowflake curve with side length length and recursion
    depth of level """`
```

The `snow_ flake_side` function should have a base case that draws the
following image:
![](https://sites.google.com/site/sd14sp/_ /rsrc/1392697696044/home/in-class-exercises/day-8/Screen%20Shot%202014-02-17%20at%2011.27.44%20PM.png?height=171&width=320)The
recursive step should replace each of the line segments above with a
`snow_flake_ side` with size `length/3.0` and recursion depth `level - 1`. Take
some time to work on this and then we'll discuss as a group.

Once you have completed your `snow_flake_ side` function, create a function
called `snow_flake` that draws the whole snowflake.


### Recursive Trees

Next, we will draw a tree using recursion. Define a function called
`recursive_ tree` that takes as input a turtle, a branch length, and a
recursion depth and draws the recursive tree to the canvas.

``` python
def recursive_tree(turtle, branch_ length, level):
    """ Draw a tree with branch length branch_length and recursion depth of level
    """
```


The base case is:

![](https://sites.google.com/site/sd14sp/_ /rsrc/1392698478798/home/in-class-exercises/day-8/Screen%20Shot%202014-02-17%20at%2011.41.04%20PM.png?height=320&width=153)This
structure is given by moving forward `branch_length` steps (assuming the
turtle has the correct orientation).

For the recursive step, you should:

1. Draw the line as above
2. Clone your turtle
3. Turn the new turtle left 30 degrees
4. Recurse using the cloned turtle to draw a tree with branch length `branch_ length*0.6` and depth `level-1`
5. Undraw the cloned turtle using the `undraw` method
6. Back the original turtle up `branch_length/3.0`
7. Clone your turtle
8. Turn the new turtle right 40 degrees
9. Recurse using the cloned turtle to draw a tree with branch length `branch_ length*0.64` and depth `level-1`
10. Undraw the cloned turtle using the `undraw` method

After implementing the recursive step, if you set `level` to 1 more than the
base case (which will either be 1 or 2 depending on what level you consider
the base case), you will get the following picture:
![](https://sites.google.com/site/sd14sp/_/rsrc/1392698259073/home/in-class-exercises/day-8/Screen%20Shot%202014-02-17%20at%2011.37.22%20PM.png?height=320&width=185)

Once you've built your `recursive_ tree` function, try making a few
enhancements:

* Make the base case change the pen color for the turtle to green (this will simulate the appearance of leaves if you do a high enough depth)
* Add some randomness to the degree of left turn, right turn, and scaling so that you get more naturalistic looking trees
* Add more than 2 branches


## More Recursion

The Koch snowflake and our recursive tree are both part of a more general
class of curves called L-systems ([Lindenmayer
Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system)). Next, read the linked
Wikipedia article on L-systems and try to implement Sierpinski's triangle and
fractal plant.

_Hint 1_ : For Sierpinski's triangle you will want to create a function to
generate both symbols A and B and have them call each other.

_Hint 2_ : For the fractal plant you should create the following functions to
save and then restore then Turtle's state (symbols "[" and "]" respectively):

``` python
def save_turtle_ state(turtle_states,t):
  turtle_ states.append((t.x,t.y,t.heading))

def restore_turtle_ state(turtle_states,t):
  s = turtle_ states.pop()
  t.x = s[0]
  t.y = s[1]
  t.heading = s[2]
```
