### Walkthrough of Creating a Pickled Dataset

Oliver will lead this activity in class using an ipython notebook.

## Mini-Project 3 Launch

We'll do a quick slide deck on cool applications of text mining. Then, we'll
have you get started on the project by doing the [Pickling toolbox](/project-toolbox/pickling). This toolbox will be especially useful in this mini-
project, and it counts towards the 5 that you have to do by the end of Spring
break (and the 3 you have to do before Spring break starts).
