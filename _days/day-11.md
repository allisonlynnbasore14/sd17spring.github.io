**Today**

* Mini project 4 kick off
* Classes - defining your own Python types
* Text mining project presentations
* In-class exercise: define geometry classes

**For next time**

* Reading journal, review Think Python 15-17
* [Choose MP4 topic and partner](/assignments/interactive-visualization#getting-started) (before Saturday)
* [MP4 project proposal](/assignments/interactive-visualization#project-proposal)


## Text mining project presentations

If you'd like to share what you discovered/created as part of your text mining
project, please add ~1-2 slides to the appropriate class presentation
[[Section 1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rTXarYGF4fp8cYALGSJv5AMNk0PIe8RnMqkDFnfAqS4/edit?usp=sharing),
[Section 2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VvfAsA7XPUs9n1CoLvAuK1CHncu4AiIKFzvzI30IDlo/edit?usp=sharing)].
You'll have a couple of minutes at the end of class today to present your
results.

Professionalism is important in public presentations, so please use the "would
I be happy for my parents to read this in the newspaper" test when uploading
content. Humor is great; abusive language or disparaging groups of people is
firmly not acceptable.

## In-Class Exercise: Geometry Classes

In this exercise, you will define methods for `Line` and `Rect` geometry
classes.

Save the file
[geometry.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{site.course.github_owner}}/ClassNotes/master/geometry.py)
to your file system, and modify it so that the doctests pass:

``` bash
python geometry.py
```

In order to run the doctests for a _single method_ , comment out
`doctest.testmod` and uncomment `doctest.run_docstring_ examples` at the end of
the file:

``` python
 doctest.testmod()
 # doctest.run_docstring_ examples(Line.__repr_ _, globals())
```
→
``` python
 # doctest.testmod()
 doctest.run_ docstring_examples(Line._ _repr_ _, globals())
```

You can use the `Point` class from the reading, but you are not required to.

Two of the methods in this file, `Line.intersection` and `Rect.intersection`,
have their doc tests commented out. (Yes, they're commented out within a
comment.) You don't need to implement these. They're the subject of the third_ Going Beyond_ exercise, below.

Think about:

1. A rectangle conceptually has_ left_,_ right_,_ top_, and_ bottom_ coordinates, as well as_ width_ and_ height_. How many of these do you need to store, and how many can be calculated? Which ones will make the implementation of the class methods simpler?
2. Line's initialization method takes two_ x_ coordinates in either order (x0 &lt; x1, or x1 &lt; x0). Is there work you could do when you initialize the object, that would make it easier to implement the methods.
3. What are the pros and cons of adding a `Square` class?

[You're encouraged to think about the first two questions before or while you
perform this exercise. Think about the last question afterwards, if you have
time.]_ If you have time_, you can extend your work in any of the following
directions. Any of these can be done independently of the others.

### Going Beyond 1: Duck Typing_ Skills emphasized: object-oriented programming (classes); polymorphism (“duck
typing”)._

Save the file
[geometry_ beyond_1.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{site.course.github_owner}}/ClassNotes/master/geometry_ beyond_1.py),implement
the methods of the `Circle` class, and implement the function stochastic_ area.
`stochastic_area` should work on either a Rect or a Circle.

Some things to think about:

* How close is stochastic_area's return value to Rect and Circle's area methods?
* What needs to be true of a class for stochastic_area to work on it?
* Are there additional classes that would be simple to implement, that you could apply stochastic_area to?
* When would you use stochastic_area instead of just `area`?

### Going Beyond 2: PyGame_ Skill emphasized: computer graphics._

Save the file
[geometry_ beyond_2.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{site.course.github_owner}}/ClassNotes/master/geometry_ beyond_2.py),
and modify the implementation of `draw_ shapes` to attend to its argument (a
list of shapes).


### Going Beyond 3: Geometry algorithms

_Skill emphasized: computation geometry and computer algorithms._

You guessed it: un-comment the test cases in `Line.intersection` and
`Rect.intersection` and make them pass.

Think about:

* What should `Line.intersection` and `Rect.intersection` do when the two lines or rectangles don't intersect? Can you think of several answers? – what are their pro and cons?


### Going Beyond 4: Test Case Design

_Skill emphasized: software engineering._

Think about the mistakes a non-malicious programmer could make while
implementing these methods. Do the test cases detect these mistakes? What
would you add?

You may do this exercise by drawing lines, squares, and points on a piece of
paper, instead of covering coordinates to numbers.
