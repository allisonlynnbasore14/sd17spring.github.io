## Project Ideation and Team Formation

We'll be doing this in a series of steps.

1. Individually – write down a bunch of project ideas on post-it notes. These could be ideas you are interested in, or just projects you think are cool.
2. As a table – share your project ideas in a round-robin fashion. React to the project ideas of others and help shape them. Possibly generate new ones.
3. Individually – write down your 2-3 favorite project ideas based on the discussion.
4. As a class – create affinity groups of post-it notes on the board. Over time clusters will emerge that can be called out as specific topics.
5. As a potential team – find a group of students that are interested in fleshing out one of these clusters more. Break away from the main group. Try to flesh out what a project (or possibly projects) in this space might look like.
6. Iterate step 5 at least one additional time so you have the opportunity to explore multiple idea areas.
7. Coalesce around a project topic – based on the previous activities, what are you most excited to work on? If you have a specific project and team already, then you are done. If not, stand by the cluster of post-its that define your interest area. You will then hopefully link up with others that are interested in the same cluster. At this point, secondary team compatibility traits (programming experience, time commitment, etc.) can be discussed.

By the end of today, you will form teams of 2-4 and [register them on the team
spreadsheet]({{site.course.final_project_proposal_spreadsheet}}).
You can also use this sheet to facilitate searching for additional team
members.
