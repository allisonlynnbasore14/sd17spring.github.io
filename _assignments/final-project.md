## Overview

From now until the end of the semester you will be working with a team of
students on a group software project. <!--The project will culminate on Thursday,
May 5th with EXPO style demo / poster session (8am-11am). Both sections will
be present concurrently for this session.-->

## Project Topic

### Requirements

* As this class is called "Software Design", your project should have a substantial software design component (interfacing with mechanical or electrical systems is great, but the software should be the major component).
* Most of the your final project should be written in Python. It is okay if some amount is written in another language, but the bulk of the project should be implemented in Python. Part of the reason for this requirement is to facilitate peer design reviews.

### Suggestions for Project Topics

* Since the the theme of this course is "computation as applied to interesting problems in science, engineering, and beyond" you may want to use this project as an opportunity to explore how computation can be applied to a discipline / problem you care deeply about. Choosing an interdisciplinary project may also allow your software design project to overlap with work you are doing in other courses (we are fine with this, but we would have to check with the other instructors to make sure this is okay). If you choose to be interdisciplinary, perhaps we can recruit an appropriate faculty angel adviser for your project.
* If you want to have some experience doing a project "for" a client, talk to faculty and staff on campus. Talk to parents and relatives with real jobs. Perhaps, they have a need that you can help with.
* Make a positive difference in the world. See broken things and fix them.
* A good project is one that meets your learning goals. For instance, if it is really important to you to learn how to create a program with a GUI, you should make sure that your project topic aligns with this learning goal.
* A good project is one that has a realistic and well-defined minimum deliverable as well as many opportunities for going beyond the minimum deliverable (depending on the pace and enthusiasm of the team).

## Teaming

### Requirements

* You are required to work on a team of 2-4 students.
* Your team must consist entirely of students from the same section of SoftDes. In other words, teams across section 1 and section 2 are not allowed.

### Team Formation Advice

* Try to **work with people because you share a common interest**  rather than simply working with your friends (we will do a structured activity to help with this aspect of team formation).
* **Work with people that want to devote similar amounts of time to the project.**  For instance, if you want to devote your life to making the best most awesomest SoftDes project EVAR, you should probably work with other people that share your ambition!
* **Work with people that envision a similar style of work on the project.**  For instance, if you really want to pair-program the entire project, but your teammates prefer to divvy up the work and work independently, that is probably not a good situation.

## Project Activities / Deliverables

### Project Proposal

_Due {{site.data.dates.final_proposal | date: '%B %d' }}_

**The project proposal is worth 5% of the project grade ([rubric]({% link _assignments/final-project/project-proposal-rubric.md %}))** .

You should come to class with a document that describes the main idea of your
project. We will have about 10 minutes to meet with each team, so we ask that
you come to the meeting without your laptop, but with a printed version of
your document. You should designate one of the two team members to take notes.
In addition to the printed document, you should also have posted this proposal
to your project website. Your document should contain the seven sections
listed below. We don't expect this proposal to be 20 pages long, but the more
detail you provide here the better help and feedback when can provide your
team (both during our face-to-face meeting and after the fact):

1. **The Big Idea:**  What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your **minimum viable product** ? What is a **stretch goal** ?
2. **Learning Goals:** What are your individual learning goals for this project?
3. **Implementation Plan:** This will probably be pretty vague initially. Perhaps at this early juncture you will have identified a library or a framework that you think will be useful for your project**.**  If you don't have any idea how you will implement your project, provide a rough plan for how you will determine this information.
4. **Project schedule:** You have 6 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Sketch out a rough schedule for completing the project. Depending on your project, you may be able to do this in great specificity or you may only be able to give a broad outline. Additionally, longer projects come with increased uncertainty, and this schedule will likely need to be refined along the way.
5. **Collaboration plan:** How do you plan to collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you split tasks up, complete them independently, and then integrate? Will you pair program the entire thing? Make sure to articulate your plan for successfully working together as a team. This might also include information about any software development methodologies you plan to use (e.g. [agile development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_ development)). Make sure to make clear why you are choosing this particular organizational structure.
6. **Risks:** What do you view as the biggest risks to the success of this project?
7. **Additional Course Content:**  What are some topics that we might cover in class that you think would be especially helpful for your project?

### Technical Reviews (3/31 and 4/21)

_Dates: {{site.data.dates.tr1 | date: '%B %d' }} and {{site.data.dates.tr2 | date: '%B %d' }}_

**Each technical review is worth 10% of the project grade (20% for both together) ([rubric]({% link _assignments/final-project/technical-reviews.md %})).**

We will be holding two technical reviews during class time. Each review will
have groups of three or four teams taking turns presenting their plans for
their project. This review is intended to very interactive, and will focus on
soliciting useful/actionable feedback rather than being a one-way brain dump.
In addition to the in-person component of this activity, there will be a
framing/agenda setting document due before the review and a
reflection/synthesis document due after.

See the [Technical Reviews]({% link _assignments/final-project/technical-reviews.md %}) page for full details about the assignment.

### Code Review

_Due: 4/14_

**The code review is worth 10% of the project grade**

On April 14th we will hold an in-class code review session. This is an
opportunity for you to give and receive detailed feedback from your peer teams
about ways to improve your project code.

See the [Code Reviews]({% link _assignments/final-project/code-reviews.md %}) page for full details about the assignment.

### Not-Quite-Mid-Project Presentation

_Date: {{site.data.dates.mid_project_presentation | date: '%B %d' }}_

**The not-quite-mid-project presentation is worth 10% of the project grade** **(see [not-quite-mid-project presentation rubric]({% link _assignments/final-project/project-presentation-rubric.md %}))**

On {{site.data.dates.mid_project_presentation | date: '%B %d' }} your team will present the progress with the project to the
class. This is intended to be a formal / polished presentation. The focus of
this activity will be around successful and professional communication. There
will be limited time for feedback in class, but you can communicate your
feedback using the online form.

### Project Website

_Due: {{site.data.dates.final_deliverables | date: '%B %d' }}_

**The final website is worth 10% of the project grade**

Your project website is the lasting record of what you have accomplished over
the course of this project, and hopefully a valuable contribution to your
professional portfolio. You should draw upon all the deliverables and
activities above to create the final site, combining, reformatting, and adding
to them to effectively tell the story of your project.

The project website can serve many audiences, including:

* Current and future SoftDes students and faculty
* Potential users of your software and those with a domain-specific interest in your topic
* Future employers
* Expo audience, broader Olin community, family

There are many successful formats for a project website, but you should
consider including:

* **Big Idea/Goal/What is this?/** **Why did we do this?**
Quick and easily understandable explanation of what your project is all about.
Consider including a narrative or example use case, e.g. via screenshots,
video, or story boarding.

* **User instructions/README**
Information to help users download, install, and get started running your
software ([README rubric]({% link _assignments/final-project/readme-rubric.md %}))

* **Implementation information**
Code doesn't tell a story by itself. Use more effective methods such as
flowcharts and architectural, class, or sequence diagrams to explain how your
code works. You could consider including or linking to snippets of code to
highlight a particularly crucial segment.

* **Results**
Though the details will be different for each project, show off what your
software can do! Screenshots and video are likely helpful. Include graphs or
other data if appropriate.

* **Project evolution/narrative**
Tell an illustrative story about the process of creating your software,
showing how it improved over time. This may draw upon what you learned from
the two peer technical reviews and from the code review. Consider the use of
screenshots or other tools to demonstrate how your project evolved.

* **Attribution**
Give proper credit for external resources used.

**_Note_**: These content prompts exist to inspire your thinking, and you should use whatever organization and sections make sense for your project and the story you're telling. Simply answering the given prompts sequentially is not the strongest way to communicate your work to an external audience. Think about what you've accomplished and frame it nicely - finish strong!

Your final project website may be implemented using whatever platform you
like. You can continue to use [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/),
possibly along with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/), or you
can switch to an easier option like [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/).
If you'd like to make a GitHub site with multiple pages using Markdown,
Patrick and Franton have written a [helpful
guide](http://phuston.github.io/patrickandfrantonarethebestninjas/howto).

Whatever implementation option you choose, you **must**  include a link to your
project website from your GitHub repository. Remember that this is part of
your professional portfolio as you select a platform - choose something that
will still be around in the future!

### Demo Session Poster

_Printed before {{site.data.dates.final_deliverables | date: '%B %d' }} at 8am_

**The poster is worth 5% of the project grade.**

Each team will create a poster to accompany the final demonstration session.
Your poster will contain similar information to your website, but reformatted
and selectively edited for a different context:

* **Poster** - large form factor, tool to support your demo (content need not stand alone without explanation)
* **Website** - one-way communication, allows for more complete/in-depth coverage

Posters must be submitted electronically via GitHub or project website, and
printed in time for the May 5th expo.

#### Code submission

_Due: {{site.data.dates.final_deliverables | date: '%B %d' }}_

**Project code is worth 40% of the project grade (see code rubric on the [course policy page]({% link policies.md %}))**

Project code must be submitted via GitHub by May 5th. You must include a
README describing how to run your code, including any required dependencies
(e.g. libraries to install) and any input files ([README rubric]({% link _assignments/final-project/readme-rubric.md %})).

Proper documentation is important to your final submission, and one way to
ensure you have adequate docstrings is to generate documentation from them.
You can do this using [pydoc](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pydoc.html):

`$ pydoc path/to/my_project.py`

This will open a help file based on your docstrings (use q to quit). Make sure
the help file would be useful to someone using your code, and feel free to
attach it to your code submission as an appendix. If you want to generate
truly beautiful documentation, check out [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) (the
tool used to generate the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/)).

Make sure that your code gives appropriate attribution to external resources
used, as per the [course policy page]({% link policies.md %}). If you have any questions
about this, just ask.

### Final Demo / Presentation Session

_Date: TBD_

During the Final Event, both sections of SoftDes will meet in AC326
for an EXPO style poster/demo session of your final projects. This session is
for everyone to share what they've created, and will not be evaluated. We will
be inviting other members of the Olin community to check out your fantastic
work.
