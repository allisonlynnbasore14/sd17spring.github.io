**Relevant Research Papers**


While the material we are covering in this class is designed to give you the
basic tools of software design, many times in the course we will bump up
against topics that are currently at the forefront of computational science.
The aim of this section of the website is to provide interested students with
some pointers to recent research papers that build on the course material. You
may find that these papers also provide ideas for the [final
project\]({% link _assignments/final-project.md %}).
